# Security Considerations

**⚠️ WARNING: This codebase has not been professionally audited. Use at your own risk.**

## Current Status: TESTNET READY, NOT MAINNET READY

This code is suitable for **Base Sepolia testnet** experimentation but should not be deployed to **mainnet** without further hardening.

## What's Actually Fixed ✅

### Smart Contract
| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Fee tracking | ✅ Fixed | `accumulatedPlatformFees` properly tracked and withdrawable |
| Fee withdrawal | ✅ Fixed | Owner can withdraw accumulated fees |
| API key hash verification | ✅ Fixed | Added `verifyApiKey()` and `confirmKeyReceipt()` functions |
| Key verification events | ✅ Fixed | `KeyVerified` event emitted on confirmation |
| Timelock on fee changes | ✅ Fixed | 24-hour delay on `scheduleFeeUpdate()` |
| Emergency pause | ✅ Fixed | Instant pause, 24-hour timelock to unpause |
| Reentrancy protection | ✅ Fixed | `nonReentrant` modifier on withdraw functions |

### CLI
| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Withdraw command | ✅ Fixed | Actually submits blockchain transactions |
| Contract address config | ✅ Fixed | Stored in config, not hardcoded |
| Input validation | ✅ Fixed | Validates addresses, amounts, durations |
| Error handling | ✅ Fixed | Proper error messages and validation |
| File permissions | ✅ Fixed | 0o600 on config file, 0o700 on directory |

### SDK
| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Undefined constants | ✅ Fixed | All constants defined in DEFAULTS object |
| HTTP validation | ✅ Fixed | Status code checks, JSON parsing validation |
| Error handling | ✅ Fixed | DACNError class with proper error codes |
| Timeout handling | ✅ Fixed | Request timeouts with AbortController |
| Retry logic | ✅ Fixed | Exponential backoff on retries |

## What's Still Risky ⚠️

### Critical Risks (Acceptable for Testnet Only)

| Issue | Risk Level | Mitigation | Mainnet Blocker? |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Private key encryption** | High | Machine-specific encryption key | ✅ YES |
| **Centralized dispute resolution** | High | Owner can arbitrarily resolve disputes | ✅ YES |
| **No multisig** | High | Single owner key controls contract | ✅ YES |
| **No formal audit** | Critical | No professional security review | ✅ YES |

### High Risks (Should Fix Before Mainnet)

| Issue | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Honest oracle griefing** | Medium | Auto-complete timeout (24h) |
| **API keys in plaintext (CLI)** | Medium | Encrypted but decryptable locally |
| **No rate limiting** | Medium | Venice API limits are external |
| **Timestamp manipulation** | Low | Minor advantage, not critical |

### Medium/Low Risks (Acceptable)

- Non-upgradeable contract (intentional for trustlessness)
- Hardcoded RPC URLs (can override via env vars)
- Maximum duration not strictly enforced

## Detailed Explanations

### Private Key Encryption (NOT SUITABLE FOR MAINNET)

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
// Uses machine-specific info to derive encryption key
const key = crypto.scryptSync(`${hostname}:${username}:${platform}:dacn-salt-v1`, ...);
```

**Why It's Not Production-Ready:**
- Root users can extract the encryption key
- Config files can't be transferred between machines
- Still vulnerable to malware that runs as user

**Production Solution:**
- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- AWS KMS / HashiCorp Vault
- MPC solutions (Fireblocks, Qredo)

### Centralized Dispute Resolution (NOT SUITABLE FOR MAINNET)

**Current Implementation:**
```solidity
function resolveDispute(bytes32 _escrowId, uint256 _providerAmount, uint256 _consumerAmount) 
    external 
    onlyOwner 
```

**Why It's Not Production-Ready:**
- Owner can steal funds by resolving disputes unfairly
- No appeal process
- No transparency into dispute resolution criteria

**Production Solution:**
- Decentralized arbitration (Kleros, Aragon Court)
- Multisig with reputable arbitrators
- Escalation process to higher courts

### Webhook Authentication

**Outbound (DACN → your endpoint): signed header**

When you subscribe with a `secret`, the backend signs every webhook body with HMAC-SHA256 and sends:

- `X-DACN-Signature: sha256=<hex(hmac(secret, body))>`
- `X-DACN-Event`, `X-DACN-Timestamp`

Your server should verify: recompute `hmac(secret, rawBody)` and compare to the header. Reject if it doesn’t match (prevents forgery and tampering).

**Inbound (your app → DACN): API key auth**

To protect who can list or delete webhook subscriptions, the backend can require an admin secret:

- Set `WEBHOOK_ADMIN_SECRET` in `.env` (optional).
- For `GET /api/webhooks/subscriptions` and `DELETE /api/webhooks/subscriptions/:id`, send header:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <WEBHOOK_ADMIN_SECRET>` or `X-API-Key: <WEBHOOK_ADMIN_SECRET>`.
- If the env is set and the request doesn’t send a matching value, respond 401.

Without this, anyone who can reach the API can list/delete subscriptions (acceptable for testnet; for production, set the secret and use the header).

---

### No Multisig (NOT SUITABLE FOR MAINNET)

**Current Implementation:**
- Single owner address controls all admin functions

**Why It's Not Production-Ready:**
- If owner key is compromised, attacker controls everything
- No recovery mechanism if owner loses key

**Production Solution:**
- Gnosis Safe with 3-of-5 multisig
- Timelock on all sensitive operations
- Social recovery mechanisms

## Testnet vs Mainnet Checklist

### Ready for Testnet ✅
- [x] Contract compiles and deploys
- [x] Basic functionality works
- [x] Major bugs fixed
- [x] CLI and SDK functional
- [x] Documentation complete

### Required for Mainnet 🚫
- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Bug bounty program (Immunefi, Sherlock)
- [ ] Multisig owner (Gnosis Safe)
- [ ] Timelock on all admin functions
- [ ] Hardware wallet integration
- [ ] Insurance fund or coverage (Nexus Mutual)
- [ ] Formal verification (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Stress testing (1000+ escrows)

## Incident Response

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email: [your-security-email@example.com] (update this!)
3. Allow 48-72 hours for initial response
4. Responsible disclosure appreciated

## Disclaimer

By using DACN, you acknowledge:

> This is experimental software. I understand that:
> - Funds may be lost due to bugs or exploits
> - The code has not been professionally audited
> - I use this at my own risk
> - I will not deploy to mainnet without addressing all critical issues
> - I will start with small amounts for testing
